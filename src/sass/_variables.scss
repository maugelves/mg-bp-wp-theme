 */

/*
 * Naming of colors is taken from Sip (a free color picker mac app: https://sipapp.io/ - free trial has no time limit).
 * This is purely so there is a common system for naming colors i.e. not $grey-dark, $grey-darker, $grey-even-darker.

/*
 * 3. Gutters.
 * ------------------
 * This is the base for all grid spacing. All spacing is a sum of this i.e.
 * Each grid item is $gutter / 2 so that when next to each they form the correct spacing.
 * Technique for this outlined here: https://alistapart.com/article/learning-from-lego-a-step-forward-in-modular-web-design
