/**
 * Main Stylesheet for the front-end of the site.
 *
 * Styles Inheritance.
 *
 * Base Theme.
 * The _index.scss in the root of the base theme's /scss folder should import the _index.scss from each sub folder i.e.
 * @imports 'atoms/index';
 * Each sub _index.scss imports everything in its subfolder i.e.
 * @imports 'inputs';
 *
 * Child Themes.
 * To avoid inhertance issues and files being directly over written,the _index.scss in the root of the child theme
 * should import all files individually i.e.
 * @import 'atoms/inputs';
 * @import 'atoms/buttons';
 * There should not be an _index.scss in sub folders in the child theme as these will overwrite ones in the base theme.
 *
 * Exceptions.
 * Exceptions to this are any files that need to overwrite base theme files.
 * For example, in order to use sass functions and mixins in child themes, these files/folders would need to be copied to
 * the child theme with the same folder structure. Variables should also overwrite base theme files.
